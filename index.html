  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm a lawyer who loves web development and programming. I work as an analyst at <a href="http://www.wolterskluwer.com/" target="_blank">Wolters Kluwer</a>, a software and information provider for legal and tax professionals. My job requires me to be a legal analyst, writer, state tax expert, data wrangler, journalist, content standards advocate, and web app developer. I love the Web, programming, and the law. I am also a former art major and editorial cartoonist who loves good design.</p>

  <p>I was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. The city's amazing architecture is what inspired my interest in art and design. I also lived in California's Silicon Valley for two years, where my interest in the Web and programming took hold.</p>
